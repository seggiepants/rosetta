##Rosetta

This is a project that shows you how to create the same program in several different languages.

Right now the following programs are available.
* MUGWUMP - From the Book "Basic Computer Games" Edited by David H. Ahl. The program can be found on page 114 or at:  https://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/showpage.php?page=114

If you have suggestions for other programs let me know.

This is not in any way affiliated with Rosetta Code http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code, but I am fond of their work and the idea is similar.
