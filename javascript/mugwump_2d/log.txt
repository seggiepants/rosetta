----------
Setup initial html, mess around a bit trying to draw a mugwump with CSS, and to see if I can dynamically change the body.

----------
More wireframe mockup to see if I can get things looking right. Lots of html and css the javascript will need to build/apply on the fly. Good news is it looks pretty nice at the moment.

The grid is now generated by javascript code instead of being hard coded. I also added a function to dynamically append a mugwump to a cell on the grid. Didn't get to putting in the selected, or opened modifiers yet. I guess I will work on keyboard control tomorrow. Maybe once that is in the rest of the game should be a more straightforward port.

Added cursor and mouse control. Right now the mouse just warps you to a square. Keyboard allows both arrows and WASD (however, the document/grid does need to have input focus for this to work. So is the next part straightforward?

----------
Moved the code over from the raspberry pi to my main computer. You can now open cells to reveal a mugwump if present.
What is left:
- Update the console.
- Limit users to a set number of guesses
- Congratulate/Console user after win/loss (no more play again y/n, just an ok button that restarts the game)
